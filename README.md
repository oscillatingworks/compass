Here is where we take our compass, it starts oscillating and helps us finding
interesting and small open source software projects. Then we analyze them, work
with them and write a tiny report about them. The final goal is find adequate
projects that we can contribute to, and ideally join them as long term maintainers,
making them part of our list of *oscillatingprojects*.

Report
------

To start reporting about a new project, just run `start-project PROJECT` and
a new directory containing a `README.md` template will be generated. There you
can write all of your updates about this project.

Phases

Evaluation time. We like the project and start digging into it, listing good and bad stuff that might help us decide what to do next. 

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/oscillating-works-lightgrey.svg?style=flat) ⇒
Project evaluation or research work is somehow stalled. Further info on its respective
report.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/oscillating-works-red.svg?style=flat) ⇒
For one reason or another, the project is discarded. We evaluated it and it just didn't work out. More info should be shown on the report.

After evaluating the project, we like it and are working on it. We keep in touch
with the authors, so they can validate our contributions.

We evaluated the project, worked with it, came to an agreement with author an became official maintainers. Yay, this is an oscillatingproject!
