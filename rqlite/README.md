Description

Replicated SQLite using the Raft consensus protocol

:thumbsup:
----------

- Project seems to be active and lacks contributors
- Missing proper documentation and maybe some devops tools (cookbooks, admin scripts, monitoring tools, etc.)
- Implemented in Go

:thumbsdown:
------------
- Need to learn Raft
- Not sure if distributed SQLite makes sense
