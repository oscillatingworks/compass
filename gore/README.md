Description
-----------
Yet another Go REPL that works nicely.Featured with line editing, code
completion, and more.


:thumbsup:
----------
- Best Go REPL out there.
- Pretty new, hence small - First commit Feb 10th.
- Got a lot of attraction (Front page in
  [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9085965))
  and more than 800 stars on Github).
- Total lack of branding or good documentation.
- Requires better open source practices: commit messages, CHANGELOG,
  etc.
- Maintained by only one person.
- Big potential: entry door to people who
  want to learn Go.
- Lot of room for better package distribution (binary distribution,
  apt, homebrew package...).

:thumbsdown:
------------
- A hardcore part of the Go community dislikes the idea of having a
  REPL for this language.
- We still don't know how eager the author would be to get external
  contributions.
- There is a similar project with same name:
  https://github.com/sriram-srinivasan/gore
- The name could be better, but that's something personal for
  the author.

Further comments
----------------

In my opinion, this project totally fits the profile of an open source software
project we are looking for: not big, maintained by an independent developer,
lot of room for improvement, best choice on its category and gaining popularity
within the community. My favorite point is that the tool can be globally distributed
(i.e. no Go installation required) and serve as an entry point for people wanting to
learn Go, which is a lot. - [@fern4lvarez](https://github.com/fern4lvarez)
