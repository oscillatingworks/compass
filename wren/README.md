Description
-----------
Wren is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language.

Think Smalltalk in a Lua-sized package with a dash of Erlang and wrapped
up in a familiar, modern syntax.

----------
- Maintaining a programming language is a super cool challenge.
- The language is new and small, i.e. easier to maintain and
  get involved into the technical discussions.
- There's still room for better documentation, examples and technical
  support in dev channels (stackoverflow, mailing list, etc.)
- Community is small, not a big list of authors, so there's still
  much room for new contributions.
- The guy works at Google (part of the Dart language team and 
  author of http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/), he knows what
  he's doing, i.e. our role would less technical, but making things
  easier for him, so he can focus on the creation and we do the
  rest of the job.
- Author is running this project independently from his employer,
  i.e. it matches our philosophy.
- No logo at all yet.

:thumbsdown:
------------
- The guy works at Google, he might have no interest on taking
  this project further than as a toy one.
- We honestly aren't huge experts in C, i.e. our technical
  contribution would be limited, at least from the beginning.
- Maintaining a language is challenging and exciting, but hard.
  We should consider this.

Further comments
----------------
As a small open source organization, maintaining a programming language
is a challenge than sooner or later we have to take. It's quite
difficult to start working on any of the well known programming languages out
there, since all of them already have a huge community and long run maintainers.
So our chance is to find a relatively new and small language that let us
do our work without the pressure of a super big community or demand of
production ready features. wren pops up as a cool, small language, with
many room for contributions in many aspects of the project. With its difficulties
and all, this could be an important milestone for us -
